Create a web application that allows users to search for information on a variety of topics. The application should fetch relevant questions and answers from popular Q&amp;A platforms like Stack Overflow and Reddit, and display them in a good manner.

Detailed Functionality:
● Search Functionality: Allow users to enter a keyword or phrase in their
preferred language. Use the APIs of Stack Overflow and Reddit to fetch
relevant questions and answers based on the user's search query.
● Result Display: Present the results in a clear and concise format, including the
title, summary, link to the original post, and top answers.
● Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter and sort the results based on various
criteria (e.g., relevance, date, upvotes, number of comments).
● Email Generation: Allow users to generate an email containing the search
results and send it to themselves or others.
● Data Caching: Store frequently accessed search results in a database for
faster retrieval.
● Data Access: No login is required; anyone can use the application.
